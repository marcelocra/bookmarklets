# Bookmarklets Collection

A curated collection of useful bookmarklets with clear documentation.

## What are Bookmarklets?

Bookmarklets are small JavaScript programs stored as bookmarks in your browser. When clicked, they run JavaScript code that can modify, enhance, or interact with the current web page.

## Using Bookmarklets

1. Browse the bookmarklets in the `examples/` directory
2. Read the documentation at the top of each file to understand what it does
3. Copy the entire `javascript:` code
4. Create a new bookmark in your browser
5. Paste the code as the bookmark's URL
6. Click the bookmark when on a web page to activate it

## Available Bookmarklets

### Examples
- **[Highlight All Links](examples/highlight-links.js)** - Highlights all clickable links on the page
- **[Show Image Alt Text](examples/show-image-alt.js)** - Displays alt text for all images
- **[Font Size Adjuster](examples/font-size-adjuster.js)** - Increases font size for better readability
